4.3 Tracking Number Entry
Tracking number is entered by:


ShipNYC (UFA and Mount Sinai)


Union teams (LBA, UFOA)


Fields captured:


tracking_number


carrier


tracking_url


entered_by and timestamp


4.4 Automated Shipping Status Updates
System polls carrier APIs or uses webhooks to update:


label_created


shipped


in_transit


out_for_delivery


delivered


fulfilled


Status changes update the member’s record and fulfillment queue

4.5 Fulfillment Status Lifecycle
States:


awaiting_shipment


shipped


in_transit


delivered


fulfilled


Transitions logged and reflected in dashboards and audit logs


4.6 Member Reassignment After Delivery
Upon delivery confirmation:


Member is removed from fulfillment queue


Member is reassigned to:


pending_first_reading: No BP reading submitted


active_members: Reading submitted within 6 months


inactive_members: No reading in past 6 months



5. Blood Pressure Monitoring
5.1 Bluetooth Sync
BP cuff pairs with app via Bluetooth


Syncs readings:


Systolic, diastolic, heart rate (optional), timestamp


5.2 Backend Storage & Classification
Readings stored in bp_readings table


Auto-classified:


normal: SBP < 140 and DBP < 90


abnormal: SBP ≥ 140 or DBP ≥ 90


5.3 Dynamic Member Lists
active_members: Reading in last 6 months


inactive_members: No reading in last 6 months


pending_first_reading: No reading ever submitted


abnormal_bp_list: Most recent BP flagged abnormal



6. Clinical Triage and Intervention (AI-Driven)
6.1 Trigger Logic
Abnormal BP auto-routes member to Clinical Review Queue


Reviewed first by AI triage system


6.2 AI Inputs

Onboarding data (PMH, lifestyle)


Medication usage


Communication history:


Call outcomes


Coaching notes


In-app messages


6.3 AI Workflow
AI assigns:


intervention_type: none / coach / NP


intervention_due_date


assigned_staff_id


Logs:


Triage reasoning


Flagged trends


Previous coaching failures or escalation history


6.4 Clinical Staff Review
Can override or confirm AI suggestion


Manual changes are logged with timestamp, staff ID, and rationale

Status: active / follow-up scheduled / resolved


7.2 AI-Based Follow-Up Logic
AI determines:


If follow-up is necessary


When the follow-up should occur


Inputs:


Call/chat outcomes


Clinical risk flags


Member sentiment


Past intervention success


If a follow-up is needed:


Member is removed from active communication list


Task enters scheduled follow-up queue


On follow-up due date:


Task is automatically returned to active list


Staff is alerted via dashboard


7.3 Human Override
Staff can:


Override AI-determined follow-ups


Reschedule, cancel, or escalate
